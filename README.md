## FEDALV Pipeline
![pipeline](pipeline.png)

Active Learning is integrated at the server level in our proposed Federated Domain Generalisation framework. Initially, a subset of source data is labelled, and over time, it is refined to retain only the most informative samples for target generalisation. Communication links with the global model operate during the Federated Learning training, and Active Learning queries are propagated once the process is complete. After just a couple of cycles, the target domain (light blue) aligns with the sources in class clusters.

## Deployment 
We recommend to create a python3 environment and install the requirements.txt file
```Shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run
